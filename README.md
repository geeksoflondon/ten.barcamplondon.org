Web Site for BarCamp London X


How to build
------------

Built using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/). Any changes should be make in
the source/ directory.

* 'bundle' to install required gems. Written for Ruby 2.1, but should work anywhere with Ruby >1.9.3
* 'middleman' to preview the site. Also, we use livereload so you can see changes to the source files live in the browser.
* 'middleman deploy' to build and deploy the site. Force-pushes to gh-pages branch in repo.
