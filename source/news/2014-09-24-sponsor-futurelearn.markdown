We’re pleased to present you the next of our sponsors for BarCamp London X: FutureLearn.

<img src="/images/sponsors/futurelearn.png">

[FutureLearn](https://futurelearn.com) is a rapidly growing education startup, backed by the Open University and based in the British Library. We offer free online courses run by many leading universities and cultural institutions from the UK and across the world.

Since our launch in October 2013, over half a million learners have joined to study a diverse range of topics, offering over [100 courses](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/upcoming). Here are some of our upcoming courses:

* [Introduction to Cybersecurity](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/introduction-to-cyber-security)
* [Web Science](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/web-science-2014-q3)
* [Data to Insight](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/data-to-insight)
* [Begin Programming](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/begin-programming-autumn-2014)
* [Start Writing Fiction](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/start-writing-fiction-2)

We help our users learn by provoking conversation around the course material, so that learners and educators learn as much from each other as from the material itself. We try to mirror this within our company, by creating a collaborative environment for the entire team including designers, developers and product managers.

We’re excited to be at BarCamp, since we’re always interested in learning from and with the community.
