We’re pleased to present you the next sponsors for BarCamp London X: Proactive and dxw.

Proactive are paperless accountants who specialise in the Tech sector. Operating strictly as a business to business provider, the team of accountants and book keepers likes to focus on getting things done. They handle year end accounts, tax returns and VAT returns quickly and cleanly, and with a minimum of fuss.

Proactive operates from an office in the heart of London and this autumn they are opening another office in Folkestone. Being paperless makes your relationship with the accountant quicker, easier and cheaper, which is surely something you’d be interested in!

For more details of the services they offer, along with their blog full of useful accounting and tax-related tips, visit their [website](http://www.proactive.uk.net/?page_id=2). You can also follow them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/proactivepaul).
