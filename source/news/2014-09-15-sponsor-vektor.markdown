We’re pleased to present you the next sponsor for BarCamp London X: vektor.

<img src="/images/sponsors/vektor.png">

vektor provides a hassle free [digital](http://vektor.co.uk/webdigital/), [design](http://vektor.co.uk/design/) and [print](http://vektor.co.uk/printing/) service. We have agency skills with in‑house production capabilities.

This means we’re in a great position to help startups create or manage brand assets and then push them into a host of production methods, including web/digital, print, clothing or signage. We love a challenge – so if you’ve got a project that’s proving hard to get off the ground, [drop us a line](http://vektor.co.uk/contact/) to see if we can help.

vektor are also passionate about the digital revolution and use a variety of geeky web tools to make our clients projects succeed. These include [jeet.gs](http://jeet.gs/), [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) and [Laravel](http://laravel.com/).

We are honoured to help sponsor Barcamp London X and will be around over the weekend to participate on the grid, learn from awesome talks and help out with the Barcamp swag. Come and fine Pete or Tim over the weekend or follow us [@vektor](https://twitter.com/vektor)
