After a three year hiatus, during which we've organised two <a href ="http://barcampberkshire.com/">BarCamp Berkshires</a> and <a href="http://hacked.io">one epic-scale hackday</a>, we are thrilled to announce that BarCamp finally returns to London for the 10th time: <a href="http://barcamplondon.org"><b>BarCamp London X!</b></a>

Microsoft has very kindly offered to host us on <b>Saturday 27th September and Sunday 28th September</b> at their offices in Central London, located a short distance from London Victoria Railway Station.
